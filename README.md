# dhcpd-leases-parser
Parse OpenBSD dhcpd.leases file

## Intro
Got so tired of not finding any working parser for the OpenBSD /var/db/dhcpd.leases file so I created one, did get some help from ChatGPT.
There are several out there but all of them require alot of python or perl addons that I do not want spend time on or bloat my clean OpenBSD machine.

## Requirements
OpenBSD, Shell and awk, thats it!

Will most likely work on any *nix that uses ISC dhcpd
